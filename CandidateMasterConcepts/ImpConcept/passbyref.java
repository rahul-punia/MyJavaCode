//Notes- How to pass by reference in Java

// One of the biggest confusions in Java is whether it is pass by value or pass by reference.

// Java is always a pass by value; but, there are a few ways to achieve pass by reference:

// Making a public member variable in a class
// Return a value and update it
// Create a single element array

// Ways to create a pass by reference

// 1. Making a public member variable in a class:
// In this method, an object of a class passes in the function and updates the public member variable
// of that object; â€‹changes are visible in the original memory address.
